- My name is Casey Snow. I just graduated from WPI with my Bachelor's in Computer Science
and I am two classes away from my Master's in CS as well. I just started working at Jahnel Group
and I'm excited to be here!

In my free time I enjoy skiing, doing puzzles and watching TV. I have also recently gotten into
disc golf. I'm not very good at it but I think its a lot of fun!
